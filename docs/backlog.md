# Backlog (own follow-ups)

Our own open items. GitHub issues are for external reports only (AGENTS.md), so internal bugs and ideas
are listed here until they get a branch. Newest first; remove an item when its PR merges.

## Bugs

- **Emoji reactions: receive and show done** (branch `feat/emoji-reactions`, 2026-10-23; design
  `docs/features/emoji-reactions/design.md`). Left: (1) a live smoke against real WhatsApp of the Baileys
  mapping (`mapWAReaction`, `mapStoredReactions`: live, change, removal, group, history), still
  **untested against real WhatsApp**; (2) **let the team react** from EzyChat (send a `react` message,
  mock first); (3) optionally show "reacted 👍 to …" in the chat list preview.
- **Flag emoji show as letters on Windows** (2026-10-22): Chrome on Windows shows 🇲🇾 as "MY" (Windows has
  no flag glyphs). Fix with a bundled country-flag font (polyfill) for the web app.

## Ideas and next steps

- **One affiliate download link** `https://ezychat.ai/download?ref=<code>` (website repo): detects
  Windows / Mac Apple silicon / Mac Intel and starts the newest published installer, buttons for the
  others. Waiting for the owner: skip or keep the download form for this link.
- **Enterprise 0.1.5 on core 0.1.48**: pins to 0.1.48; the connectors test double needs
  `GET /api/ai/agents` and `GET /api/ai/agents/1`; the Connectors card should read `useAgentSection()`
  to name the agent of the page; create `D:\dev\test-env\enterprise` (copy the earlier trial data).
- **AI agents follow-ups**: see `docs/features/custom-agents/design.md` → Follow-ups (copy items between
  agents, conflict warning, Try it as a short chat, and more).
- **Claude provider follow-ups**: test a saved Claude key from the page; wording for a Claude refusal.
