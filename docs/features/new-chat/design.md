# New chat (message a number that is not in the inbox yet)

Status: **proposal, waiting for the owner's confirmation of the mock.** No production code until then.
Created 2026-11-06 (creationOrder 35). Branch `feat/new-chat`, workbook `docs/workbooks/feat__new-chat.md`.

Owner request (Jazz, 2026-11-06, relayed by the main session): a **New chat** button that starts a conversation
with a phone number that is not in the inbox yet. Lite core, so Lite and Enterprise both get it, for both
connection types: a linked phone (Baileys) and the WhatsApp Business API (Enterprise `wa-cloud`; core `fake-api`
in dev).

Owner decisions (2026-11-06):

1. Admins can always start new chats.
2. An admin switch in Settings lets team members (agents) start new chats too. **Off by default**; the admin can
   turn it on and off again. Audited with before/after.
3. Keep it simple: one number at a time. No paste-a-list, no bulk, no CSV.

## Mock and baseline

- Mock: [mock/index.html](mock/index.html) (the whole app, run with `run.ts`), README [mock/README.md](mock/README.md).
- Baseline: the latest owner-confirmed mock, **scheduled-tasks** (`docs/features/scheduled-tasks/mock`, revision
  `426c2eb766f24e520fd4f59b66ab837c11296045`, confirmed 2026-11-06), copied from `main` afc97fd without its
  screenshots. It is a clone of google-drive with the confirmed sql-accounting screens merged in, so this mock carries
  Google Drive, SQL Account and Scheduled tasks.
- History: this proposal was first built on google-drive (`442b6317`, plus its own sql-accounting merge, commit
  `9b2a13e`). scheduled-tasks merged and became `latestConfirmed` while this PR was open, so the new-chat deltas were
  moved onto a fresh copy of it (added files copied; `proposal.ts`/`run.ts` merged three ways with google-drive as
  the base; catalog keys added by key). Nothing of the earlier own sql-accounting merge remains.
- `mock/reference.json` records the baseline, the files this proposal adds or changes and the frozen hashes.
  `node docs/features/new-chat/mock/snapshot.mjs --check` passes. The confirmed scheduled-tasks mock already fails its
  own `--check` on 7 files (the index calls it advisory); `inheritedFrozenDrift` lists them, copied unchanged.

Run (from the repository root, after `npm install`):

```bash
npx tsx --conditions=ezychat-source docs/features/new-chat/mock/run.ts --fake-wa
node docs/features/new-chat/mock/new-chat-shots.mjs   # PW_CHROMIUM=<chromium> if Playwright's own is missing
```

The run ends with `screenshots/new-chat-results.json`: 56 screenshots, 0 page errors, 0 horizontal overflow.

Mock simplifications (not the design): inboxes, the chat→inbox map and the edition live in the browser
(localStorage), so a chat started in one browser shows under the first inbox in another; the server cannot tell
inboxes apart, so "already a chat" matches the number in any inbox; Activity shows the mock's inbox id (`main`,
`support`) where the app shows the inbox name; the template picker's `Template` / `Utility` labels in zh-CN and
`All inboxes` are untranslated inherited business-api mock strings. Fixed demo rules: a number ending in **0** is
not on WhatsApp, `012-555 0142` already has a chat, the dashed **Mock only** box switches WhatsApp offline, daily
limit and template failure.

### Five-folder retention

scheduled-tasks merged first (creationOrder 35) and already pruned **claims-template**. This PR takes the next
number, **36**, and prunes the then-oldest folder, **group-management** (creationOrder 31, confirmed; its confirmed
revision `26116d59b3b9ca31b202163dc599cb96b1bf6f5e` stays recorded in the index; also recoverable with
`git checkout afc97fd -- docs/features/group-management`), so five folders remain: template-store, google-drive,
sql-accounting, scheduled-tasks, new-chat. **partner-role** (another session) is still on its own branch: whichever
of the two merges later renumbers after the other and prunes the next oldest (template-store).

## Scope

In:

- A **New chat** button in the chat list header, shown only to people allowed to start new chats.
- A dialog: **phone number** (default Malaysia +60; `012-345 6789`, `+60 12…`, `60 12…`, `0060…` and `+65 …`
  accepted), **Send from** (only with more than one visible inbox), **Name (optional)** saved to the customer
  profile. "You will message +60 12-345 6789" shows the normalised number before anything is sent.
- If the number already has a chat **in that inbox** (alias-aware: phone JID or LID), the dialog offers **Open
  chat** instead of creating anything.
- Linked phone: check on WhatsApp, ban warning, open the chat with the normal composer.
- Business API: approved template first; the chat exists only once the template is sent.
- The new chat is **assigned to the person who started it**.
- Settings → General: **Team members can start new chats** (off by default).
- Audit `chat.new_number` and `settings.new_chat_staff`; logs carry ids only.

Out (v1): several numbers at once, lists, CSV, scheduled sends; starting a **group**; starting a chat from a
customer profile or a contact book; the AI starting new chats (MCP `send_to_new_number` stays the only automated
path, under its own token scope); a per-person on/off (the switch is team-wide).

## Who can start a new chat

| Who                                           | New chat                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin                                         | Always, from every active inbox                                                 |
| Team member (agent), switch **off** (default) | Never; no button; the routes answer 403 `new_chat_not_allowed`                  |
| Team member, switch **on**                    | Only from inboxes they belong to (`inbox_members`); others answer 404           |
| Partner role (Enterprise, another session)    | **Never**, whatever the switch says (403)                                       |
| The AI member / AI agents                     | Never (no tool; `send_to_new_number` is MCP-only, token scope `inbox:send_new`) |
| An MCP token                                  | Only through `send_to_new_number`, as today, now through the shared service     |

The rule is an allowlist: `role === 'admin' || (role === 'agent' && new_chat_staff)`. Any other role an edition adds
is refused unless it changes this rule on purpose.

## Flow by connection type (decided from capabilities only)

The core never reads `inboxes.type`. It reads `capabilitiesOf(wa)`:

| `capabilities`                                   | Flow                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replyWindowHours === null` (linked phone, fake) | **Checked**: `checkNumber` → create an empty chat → open it; first message is free text or media      |
| `replyWindowHours !== null` and `templates`      | **Template first**: no number check; send the template; create the chat only on success               |
| `replyWindowHours !== null` and no `templates`   | Not available: the inbox is shown disabled in Send from, the routes answer 409 `new_chat_unsupported` |

### Linked phone (checked)

1. **Check** (`POST /api/inboxes/:id/new-chat/check`, no WhatsApp call, not counted): normalise the number; refuse a
   linked number of any inbox (`ownJids()`, like MCP); look up an existing chat in that inbox through
   `AliasStore.route(chatKey(inboxId, '<digits>@s.whatsapp.net'))` (finds the LID chat when the PN/LID pair is
   known) → `{ next: 'existing', chatJid }`; else `{ next: 'check' }`. WhatsApp disconnected → 503 `wa_disconnected`.
2. **Start** (`POST /api/inboxes/:id/new-chat`): same pre-checks again (never trust step 1), then **count** (limits
   below), then `wa.checkNumber(digits)` → null: 404 `not_on_whatsapp` (still counted). The JID WhatsApp returns is
   looked up again (a message may have arrived meanwhile, `raced` in MCP); else `chats.upsertFromWa({ jid, type: 'dm',
name: null }, inboxId)`. Then the optional name is saved to `customer_profiles` (through `CustomerRepo.save`, so
   linked chats in other inboxes share it), the chat is assigned to the starter (`chats.patch(..., { assignedTo })`,
   the normal "X took this chat" event), audit, and the web opens `/chats/:jid` with the composer focused.
3. The **ban warning** is always in the dialog (warning tone): "Only message people who expect it. WhatsApp can ban a
   number that messages people who did not ask for it. Start a chat only when the person agreed to be contacted."
4. Nothing is sent by New chat itself. The first message goes through the normal composer and send queue (text,
   media, voice note, quick replies all work). An empty chat stays if nobody writes (like Group info → Message).

### Business API (template first)

1. **Check** answers `{ next: 'template' }` (no `checkNumber`: the Cloud API has no lookup; an unknown number fails
   on send).
2. The dialog's second step is the existing template picker (the reply-window one): approved templates of the
   inbox (`GET /api/inboxes/:id/templates`), variables (`{{1}}` prefilled with the first name typed in Name), a live
   preview, templates with a media header or buttons listed but not sendable (as today). A note says: "Each template
   starts a paid conversation with Meta. Marketing templates cost more than utility ones."
3. **Start** with `template: { name, language, params }`: validated like `POST /chats/:jid/template`
   (`template_not_found`, `template_not_sendable`, `template_params`); then `wa.sendTemplate(waJid, …)` is called
   **directly, not queued** (no chat exists yet to queue in). Only when WhatsApp accepts it: the chat is created,
   the outbound message is stored with its WhatsApp id (the same stored form as `sendTemplate` today: the filled body
   with the template's name and language), name, assignment and audit as above. Any failure → 502 `template_failed`
   (or 503 offline) and **nothing is created**.
4. The chat has no `last_inbound_at`, so the existing window logic keeps free text locked ("The 24-hour reply window
   has closed … Send a template") until the customer replies.

## Limits (counted before WhatsApp is asked)

| Limit                             | Value           | Scope / note                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New numbers per **inbox** per day | 20              | Shared by the app and MCP `send_to_new_number` (one budget per WhatsApp number). 429 `new_chat_daily_limit` |
| New numbers per **user** per hour | 5               | App only. 429 `new_chat_hourly_limit` with `Retry-After`                                                    |
| MCP per token per day             | 20              | Unchanged (`SEND_LIMITS.newNumbersPerDay`), on top of the inbox budget                                      |
| Check route                       | 60/min per user | Plain rate limit (it never asks WhatsApp)                                                                   |

Counted on **Start**, before `checkNumber` (every check asks WhatsApp about a stranger's number); a "not on WhatsApp"
answer still counts; an existing chat, a format error or an own number does not. In-memory `WindowLimiter`s, like
MCP today (a restart resets them; see open question 2). The dialog shows "3 of 20 new chats used today on Kopi Apong"
for checked inboxes. For a template-first inbox see open question 3.

## Shared service (reuse MCP `send_to_new_number`)

Extract from `packages/server/src/mcp/send.ts` a core service `packages/server/src/chats/new-chat.ts`
(`ctx.services.newChat`, created in `initMessaging` after the message service):

```ts
interface NewChatService {
  /** Format, own number, existing chat (alias-aware), capability, connection; never asks WhatsApp. */
  precheck(actor: NewChatActor, inboxId: number, phone: string): NewChatPrecheck;
  /** Counted, then checkNumber + empty chat (checked) or template send + chat (template first). */
  start(
    actor: NewChatActor,
    inboxId: number,
    input: NewChatStart,
  ): Promise<{ chatJid: string; created: boolean }>;
}
type NewChatActor =
  { via: 'app'; user: UserRow; ip: string | null } | { via: 'mcp'; user: UserRow; tokenId: number };
```

- `normalizePhone(raw, defaultCountry)` moves to `packages/shared` (the web's live preview and the server use the
  same function; table-driven tests).
- MCP `sendToNewNumber` keeps its contract (scope check, `requestId` idempotency, token limits, `NEW_NUMBER_WARNING`,
  `template_required` for a window inbox) and calls `newChat.start({ via: 'mcp', … })` for the check + create, then
  its own `send()`. Its tests stay green unchanged except the audit action (below).
- Group Info → Message (`groups/service.ts startChat`) stays as it is: it opens a chat with a known group member,
  needs no number check and is not limited; it only reuses the service's "existing chat" lookup.

## Settings switch

- Setting key **`new_chat_staff`** (`settings` table, `'1'`/`'0'`; missing = off, so existing installs need no
  migration and stay admin-only).
- `GET /api/settings` gains `newChatStaff: boolean` (zod default `false`); `PATCH /api/settings` `{ newChatStaff }`
  (admins); audit **`settings.new_chat_staff`** `{ before, after }` (only when it changes).
- Everyone learns whether they may start a chat from `GET /api/me` → `canStartNewChat: boolean` (computed on the
  server from role + setting; zod default `false`), refreshed on the existing `settings:changed` socket event, so
  the button appears or disappears without a reload.
- Web: Settings → General card **New chats**: "Start a WhatsApp chat with a number that is not in the inbox yet.
  Admins can always do this." Switch **Team members can start new chats**, the on/off line, the limits line, Save.

## API contract (zod in `packages/shared/src/new-chat.ts`)

```ts
export const NewChatCheckBody = z.object({ phone: z.string().trim().min(1).max(40) });
export const NewChatCheckResponse = z.discriminatedUnion('next', [
  z.object({ next: z.literal('existing'), phone: z.string(), chatJid: z.string() }),
  z.object({
    next: z.literal('check'),
    phone: z.string(),
    usedToday: z.number().int(),
    dailyLimit: z.number().int(),
  }),
  z.object({ next: z.literal('template'), phone: z.string() }),
]);
export const NewChatBody = z.object({
  phone: z.string().trim().min(1).max(40),
  name: z.string().trim().max(100).optional(),
  /** Idempotency: a retry with the same id answers the first result and counts nothing. */
  clientRequestId: z.string().uuid(),
  template: SendTemplateBody.optional(), // { name, language, params }
});
export const NewChatResponse = z.object({ chatJid: z.string(), created: z.boolean() });
```

Both are mutating `/api` routes: session + Host + Origin checks as usual; `web-client-contract.test.ts` covers the
web calls. Server messages stay English; the web maps the codes to `inbox:newChat.problems.*`.

## Inbox access

`canOpen(scopeFor(ctx, user), inboxId)` or 404 (never "exists but not yours"); a removed inbox 409 `inbox_removed`.
Agents see only their inboxes in Send from. Lite (one inbox) shows no Send from. The new chat gets the inbox's
chat key (`<waJid>#<id>` for inbox 2+), so it lands in that inbox's socket room and only people with access see it.
An edition limit never widens access.

## Audit and logs

- `chat.new_number` `{ inboxId, chatJid, userId, via: 'app' | 'mcp', tokenId? }`, never the number's name or the
  message/template text. MCP writes this action too (replacing `mcp.new_chat`; old rows keep their label).
- The optional name goes through the profile save, audited as today (`customer.profile_update`, field names only).
- `settings.new_chat_staff` `{ before, after }`.
- Logs (`mod: 'new-chat'`): inbox id, user id, via, outcome (`created`, `existing`, `not_on_whatsapp`, `limit`,
  `template_failed`), ms. Never the phone number, name or template values.

## Security invariant (proposed text for AGENTS.md)

> - New chat (`chats/new-chat.ts`, `/api/inboxes/:id/new-chat[/check]`): only admins, or agents while
>   `new_chat_staff` is on, and only from inboxes they may open (else 404); every other role (partner, AI) is
>   refused. One number per request; counted before `checkNumber` (20 a day per inbox, shared with MCP
>   `send_to_new_number`; 5 an hour per user); a template-first inbox (`replyWindowHours`) creates the chat only after
>   WhatsApp accepted the template. Audit `chat.new_number` and logs carry ids only, never the number's name or
>   message text. The core decides the flow from `WaCapabilities`, never from an inbox type name.

## Migration and upgrade

None. `new_chat_staff` missing = off; limits are in memory. `upgrade-from-oldest.test.ts` is unaffected. (If the
owner wants limits to survive a restart, open question 2, that adds migration 036 `new_chat_counts`.)

## Test plan

Unit (server, Vitest, fake WA and `fake-api` inbox):

- `normalizePhone` table: local `01x`, `+60`, `60`, `0060`, spaces/dashes/brackets, `+65`, too short/long, letters.
- Permissions: admin yes; agent off → 403; agent on → yes, only member inboxes (404 otherwise); a non-agent role
  (partner fixture) → 403 with the switch on; AI user → 403.
- Existing chat: by phone JID, by LID through `jid_aliases`, inbox 2 key; another inbox's chat does not count.
- Own number (any inbox, also a removed one) → 400; disconnected → 503; removed inbox → 409.
- Counted before the check; not-on-WhatsApp counted; existing/invalid not counted; daily limit shared with MCP
  (19 app + 1 MCP → the 21st refused on either path); hourly per user; `clientRequestId` retry counts once.
- Raced chat (inbound arrives during `checkNumber`) → `created: false`, no duplicate.
- Template first: no `checkNumber` call; validation errors; send failure → no chat row, no message, no audit; success
  → one chat, one outbound message, `last_inbound_at` null, free text 409 `window_closed`.
- Assignment event, profile name saved, audit meta exact (no text), log line fields.
- Settings: PATCH audits before/after only on change; `canStartNewChat` in `/api/me`; socket refresh.
- MCP `send_to_new_number` regression suite unchanged (except `chat.new_number` audit).

Contract: `web-client-contract.test.ts` (literal paths). Web: dialog states (Testing Library), catalog tests for
en/ms/zh-CN. E2E (fake WA): admin starts a chat and sends; agent with the switch off sees no button, on sees it;
`multi-inbox` project: agent's Send from lists only their inboxes; `fake-api` inbox: template flow, send error,
window-closed panel after. Dev Build: linked phone `checkNumber` against **real WhatsApp** on a test number (never a
real customer); Business API untested without an Enterprise `wa-cloud` number (say so).

Screen review per AGENTS.md before done (1280/360, light/dark, all states above).

## Open questions for the owner

1. **One daily budget per WhatsApp number**, shared by the app and AI assistants (MCP), 20 a day: OK? (Recommended:
   yes; MCP keeps its own 20 per token on top.)
2. **Limits reset on restart** (in memory, like MCP today): OK, or keep counts in the database (one small migration)?
   (Recommended: in memory for v1.)
3. **Business API new chats**: count them in the 20/day (Meta already limits business-started conversations by tier,
   and each costs money) or only the 5/hour per person? (Recommended: only 5/hour; Meta's tier governs the rest.)
4. **Default country**: always +60, or the country code of the sending inbox's own number (a Singapore number would
   default to +65)? (Recommended: the inbox's own country code, +60 fallback.)
5. The new chat is assigned to the starter, so an AI agent does **not** answer the customer's reply until someone
   unassigns it or hands it to the AI. OK? (Recommended: yes.)
