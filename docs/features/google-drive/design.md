# Google Drive connector

Status: **proposal: mock built, owner confirmation pending** (see "Mock and confirmation").
Created 2026-11-05 (creationOrder 33). Owner request (Jazz, 2026-11-05): a Google Drive connector so an AI agent can
(1) save files to Google Drive and (2) read files from Google Drive, both through one connector. Built like Google
Sheets (`packages/server/src/connectors/google-sheets/`, design in git history `docs/features/google-sheets/design.md`
at `f3e8f37`) on the shared Google sign-in `connectors/google-account.ts`.

## Scope

A core (Lite and Enterprise) built-in connector, listed in Admin → Connectors beside Google Calendar and Sheets
(`builtin` entry `google-drive` in the connector list and in `connectors/list/builtin-list.ts`):

- **Sign-in**: its own Google account connection (`google_drive_tokens`, `google_drive_problem`), separate from
  Calendar and Sheets, so disconnecting one never stops another. Scope `drive.file` only.
- **Per AI agent**: one **folder** (picked in Google's own file picker), **Save files** (off by default; a change to
  the business's data), **Read files** (on by default once a folder is picked) with the list of **files the AI may
  read** (picked in the picker, at most 50). What to save and when is said in the agent's **instructions** (the Sheets
  pattern); the Settings tab shows an example line and links to the instructions.
- **AI tools** (core names reserved): `save_file_to_drive`, `list_drive_files`, `read_drive_file`.
- **Activity** (who and when) and the chat line "Aina saved a file to Google Drive" / "Aina read a file".

Out of scope (v1): editing, renaming, moving or deleting Drive files; reading files the admin did not pick; Shared
drives' special permissions beyond what `drive.file` gives; OCR of scanned PDFs or images; Google Slides; video and
audio saving (a voice note is not a file to keep).

## Google scope decision (recorded 2026-11-05)

What `drive.file` gives (Google "Choose Drive API scopes"; non-sensitive): per-file access to files **the app
created** and files **the user opened or shared with the app through the Google Picker**. Picking a **folder** in the
picker (`setSelectFolderEnabled(true)`) grants access to that folder item: the app can create files and sub-folders
in it, and everything it creates stays accessible. Google documents nothing that extends the grant to the folder's
**existing children**; developer reports (Nango, product-oracle #81) find files inside a picked folder still answer
404 until each is picked. So with `drive.file`:

| Need                                         | `drive.file`                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Save into the picked folder (+ sub-folders)  | Yes                           |
| Read files EzyChat saved                     | Yes                           |
| Read files the admin picks in the picker     | Yes (each file, multi-select) |
| Read any file already in the folder, unasked | No (would need a wider scope) |

Options for reading "whatever is in the folder":

| Option                                  | Classification | Google cost                                                                          | Reach                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| A. `drive.file` + admin picks the files | Non-sensitive  | None beyond brand verification (already done for Sheets)                             | Only what is picked       |
| B. `drive.readonly`                     | Restricted     | Restricted-scope review + yearly third-party security assessment (CASA), weeks, paid | Every file in the account |
| C. `drive` (full)                       | Restricted     | Same as B                                                                            | Every file, read + write  |

**Decision: A.** It meets the request (save into a folder; read the files the business wants the AI to answer from)
with the least privilege, no new Google review, and the same picker the owner already enabled for Sheets
(`GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_PICKER_APP_ID`). The cost is one step for the admin: **Add files** in the picker
(multi-select, opened in the agent's folder). B/C would give a desktop app read access to the whole Drive of the
business for a feature that needs a handful of files; not worth the audit or the risk. If owners later ask for "read
everything in the folder", revisit with B as a separate, opt-in sign-in.

Owner to do in `ezychat-prod` (once): add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` to the consent screen if not
already there (Sheets added it), keep the Picker API enabled; no new secret.

## Rules (fail closed)

**Save files** (`save_file_to_drive {messageId}`):

1. The tool takes the **id of a message in this chat** from the conversation the model sees (never a URL, path,
   bytes or a file name from the model). The server loads that stored message and checks: same chat, inbound
   (`from_me = 0`), not deleted, has media, media downloaded (history media `pending` is downloaded on demand first,
   like `GET /api/media/:id`), type allowed by the agent's ticks (photos / PDFs / documents; never audio or video
   in v1), size ≤ **25 MB**.
2. **WhatsApp Safety**: never a message with a High safety item or quarantined media (`safety_locked`), never a
   `cantInspect` ZIP. Refusal text tells the AI to hand over (`sensitive`), and Activity records "skipped".
3. In a **group** (decided: allowed, like `add_sheet_row`, the one other write a group turn keeps): only when the
   agent answers that group and the message was sent by a member in the turn's batch (`SheetRecordContext`
   personJids/messageIds), so a later message cannot make the AI save someone else's older file.
4. **Never twice**: table `drive_saved_files` keyed by (agent, chat, message id, folder id); a retry answers
   "already saved" and adds nothing.
5. **Name**: EzyChat names it `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm <Photo|PDF|Document> <4-char ref>.<ext>` in the AI time zone, the
   extension from the type read from the bytes (not the customer's file name). Sub-folder: a folder per day
   (`YYYY-MM-DD`, default), a folder per customer (`<saved name or WhatsApp name> (+<number>)`, sanitised, max 80
   characters; groups: the group's name) or the folder itself. Sub-folders are created by EzyChat (so `drive.file`
   covers them) and remembered by id (`drive_folders`).
6. **Try it** never saves (`notRun`). Save files off, no folder, Google expired/unreachable → the tool is not
   offered or answers "not available"; a Google failure ends the turn with `lookup_failed` (hand-over), like Sheets.
7. Upload: Drive API v3 multipart (≤ 5 MB) or resumable upload (> 5 MB), `uploadType` with `supportsAllDrives=true`,
   parents = the folder; the AI is told "saved" only after Google answers with the new file id.

**Read files** (`list_drive_files {query?}` + `read_drive_file {fileId}`):

1. Offered only when Read files is on and at least one picked file is readable. `list_drive_files` returns only the
   agent's picked files (name, kind, modified time, id) that match the words of `query` (all when ≤ 20).
2. `read_drive_file` accepts only an id from that list (others: "not available"). Google Docs → export
   `text/plain`; Google Sheets → export `text/csv` (first sheet); PDF / Word (.docx) / text / CSV / Markdown → download
   ≤ 10 MB and extract with the existing `extractKnowledgeIsolated` worker (unpdf, mammoth). Text capped at
   **20,000 characters** per call (the rest summarised as "truncated; ask for a narrower question"), cached 2 minutes.
3. Results are **facts for the reply**, data never instructions (same wording as `read_sheet_rows`); a Drive look-up
   counts as a look-up source (`agentLookupsAvailable`), so an agent with readable files may run with an empty
   Business context.
4. Files a customer sent and the AI saved are **never** readable through these tools (no cross-chat leaks): the read
   list holds only files an admin picked.
5. Allowed in group turns and Try it (look-ups).

**Logs, audit, Activity**: logs carry event, tool, ok, ms, counts, sizes and kinds only; never file names, contents,
folder names or customer names. Audit `google_drive.connect` / `.disconnect` / `.agent_settings` {agentId, fields}.
Activity rows store kind, agent id, chat id, time and reason (`saved`, `read`, `skipped` {safety|size|type|already},
`failed`); the page joins the chat's name at read time like Sheets. Chat line: `ai_tool_used` with `drive`
{action: saved|read}.

## Server

- `connectors/google-drive/` — `drive.ts` (Drive v3 client: files.get, files.list by ids, create folder, multipart
  and resumable upload, export, download with byte cap), `service.ts`, `tools.ts`, `repo.ts` (only SQL), `fake.ts`
  (`FakeGoogleDrive`: picker grants, folders, uploads in memory; `/api/dev/fake-google-drive*`), `names.ts` (file and
  folder names), picker page reuse (`picker-page.ts` made generic: view = folders or files, multi-select, parent).
- Migration 034: `drive_agent_settings` (agent_id PK, settings JSON), `drive_saved_files`, `drive_folders`,
  `drive_activity`. `chats/merge.ts` moves the chat-keyed rows.
- Routes `/api/connectors/google-drive/*` (admins): status, connect, progress, host-only callback, disconnect,
  `POST /picker {kind: folder|files, agentId}` + `GET /picker/:requestId`, picker page/config/result (host-only,
  one-time token, 10 min), `GET/PUT /agents/:agentId`, `GET /activity`.
- Shared contract in `packages/shared` (`DriveAgentSettings`, status, picker, activity) first.

## Web

`admin/connectors/GoogleDrivePage.tsx` (Overview / Settings / Activity, `?tab=` and `&agent=`), reusing
`google-connect.tsx`, the account-card layout of `GoogleSheetsAccountCard.tsx`, `AgentPicker`, SaveBar and paused
banner patterns of `SheetsSettingsCard.tsx`; `AgentConnectorsCard.tsx` row; catalog `connectors.googleDrive.*` in
en / ms / zh-CN; InfoTip `driveFiles` ("Why pick files?"); every screen at 360 px.

## Screens and states (checklist, all in the mock)

- Gallery: Google Drive card (Not connected / Connected / Needs attention) beside Google Calendar.
- Overview: About (Save a file = changes data; Find, Read = look-ups), account card (not connected with Connect,
  consent with the `drive.file` wording, connected, sign-in expired with Sign in again, unreachable, Disconnect
  confirm), Your data.
- Settings: not connected; no folder; folder picker (and blocked window); folder chosen (Open in Google Drive, Choose
  another folder: clears the picked files); Save files switch disabled without a folder, on with a folder per day /
  per customer / the folder itself and an example path, file types, the four rules; Read files with the file list
  (kind, text size, no-text warning, remove), Add files picker opened in the folder, at most 50; When to use Drive
  (example instruction, link to the agent's instructions); Save bar (unsaved, discard); paused banner; 2+ agents
  picker (inherited `AgentSettings`).
- Activity: empty, saved, read, skipped (Safety, too large), failed.
- Agent page → Connectors: "No folder chosen", "Saves files", "Reads N files", "Saves files and reads N files", Off.
- Mock only simulator: photo saved (per sub-folder choice), PDF, question answered from a picked file, no readable
  file, Save files off, type not ticked, Safety-locked, too large, paused → hand-over.

## Owner decisions (my calls, easy to change)

1. Scope `drive.file`, read = files the admin picks (option A above).
2. Save files **off** by default; Read files **on** once a folder is picked; default sub-folder **a folder per day**.
3. Saving allowed in **groups** (sender of the batch only), like Sheets rows.
4. Limits: 25 MB a saved file; 50 readable files per agent; 10 MB per read file and 20,000 characters per read.
5. Photos, PDFs and documents only; no video or voice notes in v1.
6. Separate Google sign-in from Calendar and Sheets.
7. Beta badge in the connector list while it is new, like Sheets.
