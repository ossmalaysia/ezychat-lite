# Releasing EzyChat Lite

The release flow for **EzyChat Lite** (this repository, public). **EzyChat Enterprise** has its own flow in
its repository: `anchorsprint/ezychat-enterprise` → `docs/releases.md` (self-hosted runners, installers and
`latest.json` on `dl.ezychat.ai`, published automatically by its `v*` tag). Enterprise always follows a Lite
release: it moves its `@ezychat/*` pins to the new version first.

**Cadence:** one release a day of both editions when something changed; merge without releasing unless the
change is important (owner rule). Merge only on the owner's explicit request, including the release PR.

## 1. Release PR

On a branch `chore/release-<version>` from `main`:

1. Bump the root `package.json` version, run `npm run version:sync`, then
   `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` (all workspaces and the lockfile agree).
2. In `CHANGELOG.md`, add `## [<version>] - <date>` under `## [Unreleased]` so the unreleased entries move
   into it. **Write it in plain language for users**: this section becomes the GitHub release notes and the
   "What's new" text of the in-app update dialog (`scripts/release-notes.mjs`). A tag without a section
   stops the release workflow before it builds.
3. Check the notes: `node scripts/release-notes.mjs v<version>`.
4. Open the PR `chore(release): <version>`; wait for CI; merge when the owner asks.

## 2. Tag

On the merge commit, an annotated tag: `git tag -a v<version> <commit> -m "EzyChat Lite <version>"`, then
`git push origin v<version>`. If a fetch or push fails (network), check both sides before you retry:
`git rev-list -n1 v<version>` (local tag) and `git ls-remote --tags origin v<version>` (remote tag) — a failed
`git fetch` earlier in the same command can skip the tag step entirely. The tag starts two workflows:

| Workflow               | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `release.yml`          | Builds Windows x64 (signed through Azure), macOS arm64 and macOS x64 on GitHub-hosted runners; smoke-tests the packaged server; creates a **draft pre-release** with the notes from `CHANGELOG.md` and uploads each installer twice: the versioned file (`EzyChat-Lite-<version>-win-x64.exe`, used by the in-app updater) and a copy without the version (`EzyChat-Lite-win-x64.exe`, for permanent download links). |
| `publish-packages.yml` | Publishes `@ezychat/shared`, `wa`, `server`, `web`, `desktop` to npm (trusted publishing). Enterprise needs these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## 3. Publish

1. Check the draft: `gh release view v<version>` — 6 installer files (3 versioned + 3 copies) and the notes.
2. Check npm: `npm view @ezychat/server version` (and the other four).
3. Publish in **one** call: `gh release edit v<version> --draft=false --prerelease=false --latest`.
   Without `--prerelease=false` GitHub refuses "Latest" and installed apps ignore the release.
4. Check: `gh api repos/ossmalaysia/ezychat-lite/releases/latest -q .tag_name` shows the new tag.

Installed apps find the update at their next check and jump straight to it (never through older
versions: every upgrade step lives in a migration or start-up code, see `AGENTS.md`).

## 4. Download links (never change)

| Link                                                                                            | Gives                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://ezychat.ai/download` (partners add `?ref=<code>`) — **planned**, website repo          | Detects Windows / Mac and starts the newest installer; buttons for the others (website repo) |
| `https://github.com/ossmalaysia/ezychat-lite/releases/latest/download/EzyChat-Lite-win-x64.exe` | Newest Windows installer                                                                     |
| `…/releases/latest/download/EzyChat-Lite-mac-arm64.dmg`                                         | Newest Mac installer (Apple silicon)                                                         |
| `…/releases/latest/download/EzyChat-Lite-mac-x64.dmg`                                           | Newest Mac installer (Intel)                                                                 |
| `https://github.com/ossmalaysia/ezychat-lite/releases/latest`                                   | The newest release page                                                                      |

GitHub's `latest` counts only published, non-pre-release releases, so links keep giving the previous
version until step 3. Never rename the copies: shared links depend on them.

## 5. After the release

- Enterprise: pins to the new core version, its own release (`docs/releases.md` there).
- A bad release is fixed by a **new** version (hotfix), never by deleting a published release: installed
  apps may already run it.
- Update `docs/backlog.md` for items the release closed.
