# Screenshots

Product screenshots for the website, release notes and docs, one folder per module. Every shot uses
demo data only: the fictional "Kopi Apong" coffee shop on fake WhatsApp. No real customers or numbers.

| Folder                 | What it shows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

File names are `<screen>-<desktop|mobile>[-dark].png`: desktop is 1280×800, mobile 360×780, both at 2× pixel
density. Dark variants exist for the inbox, the conversation and the chat an AI assistant started. `inboxes/` comes from `node e2e/inbox-screens.mjs <url> <dir>` on a `--max-inboxes 3` Dev Build, so it shows the Dev Build badge.

## Refresh

Run this whenever a UI change affects a module, on a **fresh** data folder:

```bash
npm run build -w @ezychat/web
npx tsx packages/server/src/cli.ts --data <new temp dir> --port 7477 --fake-wa --mode standalone --web-dist apps/web/dist
node e2e/marketing-screenshots.mjs 7477 docs/screenshots
```

`--mode standalone` keeps the "Dev Build" badge out of the shots. The script saves a placeholder AI key and
leaves the AI member off, so it never calls OpenAI or ChatGPT.

## AI reply suggestions

`chat/suggest-*` and `ai-settings/reply-suggestions-settings-*` come from
`node e2e/reply-suggestions-screens.mjs <port> <out dir>` on the standalone server above (fresh data). The
script seeds two chats and answers the three AI calls in the browser with demo drafts, so no model is called.

`chat/phrase-completion*`, `ai-settings/suggest-model-settings-*` and `ai-settings/phrase-*` come from
`node e2e/reply-phrases-screens.mjs <port> <out dir>` on the same kind of server: the status, the phrase lists
and the model info are answered in the browser with demo phrases (English, Malay, Chinese).

## Customer enrichment

This module has 44 production UI captures at 1280×900 and 360×800 in both themes, including off,
editing, enabled, rules, paused, error, Audit, added/replaced details, long policy and source customer.
Its runner always uses a fresh temporary fake-WA data directory. Build the web and copy it into
`.playwright-mcp/enrichment-web` before starting the runner; stop any runner serving that copy
before refreshing it.

```powershell
node --import tsx e2e/enrichment-devbuild.ts --fake-wa --mock-ai --port 7490
node e2e/enrichment-screens.mjs 7490 docs/screenshots/customer-enrichment
```

Seed the fictional `aisyah` / `demo-pass-123` admin and new direct-chat messages first, enable
enrichment and exercise an addition and replacement. The screenshot runner requires the mock-AI
server marker, so it cannot run against the installed app or a real provider. Normal Audit captures
reuse actual generated audit rows; paused/error and long-policy states are network fixtures.
