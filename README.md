## Why

We built EzyChat as an internal tool to help businesses manage sales conversations. To make
that work useful to more businesses, we are open-sourcing **EzyChat Lite**: a rewritten,
self-hosted version inspired by [EzyChat](https://ezychat.ai/), with a focus on security,
easy setup, and a simple daily workflow for small teams.

Small teams often share one business WhatsApp number on one phone. Someone has to hold the phone,
replies get missed, and nobody knows who is handling which customer. EzyChat Lite links that
number once and lets everyone on the team answer from their own phone or laptop, with assignment
and internal notes, and with no cloud service in the middle: your messages stay on your computer.

The goal is practical: give businesses a free foundation for managing customer conversations,
then build towards an optional **bring-your-own-key (BYOK) sales agent** and a **light CRM**.
Those are planned features, not part of today's inbox. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for priorities.

## Features

- **Link one number** by scanning a QR code; recent history is imported (configurable number of days).
- **Shared inbox**: everyone sees every chat, with assignment, open / resolved status, unread counts and search.
- **Internal notes** and system events in the timeline, clearly separate from customer-visible messages.
- **Messaging**: text, replies (quotes), images, video, audio and documents in both directions, group chats,
  typing indicators, delivery and read ticks, a send queue that survives short disconnects, and retry for failed sends.
- **Quick replies** with a `/` picker.
- **Installable PWA**, fully responsive down to 360px, with **web push notifications** for new messages
  (sent to the assignee, or to everyone when a chat is unassigned).
- **Access anywhere**: on the same computer, over your LAN, or from anywhere through a Cloudflare
  quick tunnel (no account needed) or your own named tunnel. `cloudflared` is bundled.
- **Admin**: members and roles, WhatsApp connection status and relink, tunnel control, settings,
  audit log and log download.
- **Two run modes**: standalone while the app is open, or a boot-time OS service that runs with
  nobody signed in (Windows service / macOS launchd daemon).
- **Nightly local backups** of the database and WhatsApp session (last 7 kept).
- **Security-minded defaults**: argon2 passwords, hashed sessions, login lockout, Host/Origin checks,
  first-admin setup only from the computer itself.

## Install

Download the latest installer from the
[**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/ossmalaysia/ezychat-lite/releases) page:

| Platform              | File                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10/11 (x64)   | `EzyChat-Lite-<version>-win-x64.exe`   |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `EzyChat-Lite-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel)         | `EzyChat-Lite-<version>-mac-x64.dmg`   |

The builds are **not code-signed** yet, so your OS will warn you the first time:

- **Windows SmartScreen** ("Windows protected your PC"): click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **macOS Gatekeeper** ("cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"): open the dmg,
  drag the app to Applications, then **right-click (or Control-click) the app → Open → Open**.
  On recent macOS versions you may instead need **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

Only download installers from this repository's Releases page.

Earlier releases used the **WA Team Inbox** name and `WA-Team-Inbox-…` filenames.
The rebrand keeps the existing data folders and service identity so upgrading preserves your
linked number, team accounts and conversation history. Internal npm workspace names remain
`@wa-team-inbox/*` for compatibility, and the Windows executable retains its legacy filename
so installed background services can still start it.

## Quick start

1. **Open EzyChat Lite.** It starts a local server and opens the inbox window. On first run, create
   the admin account (this is only allowed from the computer running the app).
2. **Link your number.** Go to **Admin → WhatsApp**, then on your phone open WhatsApp →
   **Settings → Linked devices → Link a device** and scan the QR code.
3. **Invite your team.** In **Admin → Members**, add each person with a username and a temporary
   password (they change it at first sign-in). Give admins the admin role.
4. **Make it reachable.** In **Admin → Cloudflare**, use **Temporary link** to get a public
   `https://….trycloudflare.com` URL (it changes on every start), or choose
   **Your domain** for a stable hostname: sign in to Cloudflare, approve your domain, choose an
   address and tunnel name, then select **Create and connect inbox**. The app creates the tunnel and
   DNS record without replacing existing websites. Existing tunnel tokens remain under **Advanced**.
   Alternatively enable **LAN mode** in Settings for
   access on your local network only.
5. **On each phone:** open the URL, sign in, then **Add to Home Screen** (Safari share menu on
   iOS, browser menu on Android) and allow notifications. On iOS, push notifications only work from
   the installed Home Screen app, not from a Safari tab.

## Run modes

|               | Standalone (default)                                                            | Background service                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runs when     | the desktop app is open (closing the window keeps it in the tray)               | the computer is on, even with nobody signed in                                |
| Data folder   | your user profile                                                               | `C:\ProgramData\wa-team-inbox` / `/Library/Application Support/wa-team-inbox` |
| How to switch | tray → **Status & Service…** → enable / disable service (asks for admin rights) | same                                                                          |

When the service is installed, the desktop app is just a window onto it. The tray menu also offers
**Reset admin password…**, the only way to recover the admin account.

## Updates

The hosting desktop checks GitHub for new published releases and suggests an update.
Use **About EzyChat Lite → Check for updates** or the tray menu to check manually.
Phone and browser clients update with the host and have no update alerts.
See [the update guide](docs/updating.md) for installation and background-service steps.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.

Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for how the pieces fit together and
[docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md) before touching the UI. Release testing with a real
number follows [docs/manual-test-checklist.md](docs/manual-test-checklist.md).
