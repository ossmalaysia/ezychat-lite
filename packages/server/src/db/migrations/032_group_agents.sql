-- Several AI agents per WhatsApp number (docs/features/group-agents/design.md, Part B).

-- 1. `ai_agents.inbox_id` loses its UNIQUE constraint: an inbox may have several agents (at most one
-- answering direct chats, checked by the server). SQLite cannot drop a column constraint in place,
-- so the table is rebuilt with the same ids. Migrations run with foreign keys on, so dropping the old
-- table deletes the rows of every table that references it (ON DELETE CASCADE): they are kept in
-- temporary copies and put back unchanged.
-- (items without an agent are not deleted and stay as they are)
